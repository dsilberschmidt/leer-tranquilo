# Leer Tranquilo

**Leer Tranquilo** is a lightweight browser extension (Chrome/Brave/Edge, MV3) that acts as a *reading agent*.  
It automatically expands all hidden comments (“Read more”) and freezes the section to prevent reloads or reordering while you read.  
Designed for a calm reading experience on news sites, forums, and e-commerce reviews.

## 🚀 Installation (Developer Mode)
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` → enable **Developer mode**.
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `/src` folder.
4. A floating button *Expand & Freeze* will appear on supported pages.

## ✨ Features
- **Expand** all hidden comment threads with one click.  
- **Auto-scroll** to force lazy-loaded comments to appear.  
- **Freeze** the comment section into a static snapshot — no more live reloads or reordering.  
- Works on major providers (Viafoura, Coral, Disqus) with generic heuristics.

## 🎯 Hackathon Context
This project was built for **HackOmatic 2025** as an example of an *agentic automation assistant*.  
Instead of fighting dynamic, constantly refreshing web interfaces, the agent acts on behalf of the user, letting humans focus on comprehension.  

---

## ⚠️ Notes
- Still experimental — some highly dynamic sites may require running the agent more than once.  
- No data is collected. Everything runs locally in the browser.
